# Product Roadmap

This document outlines the major milestones we have in mind for improving the Document Management System.

## M1

*   **Automated Integration Tests with Testcontainers**: Implement a comprehensive suite of automated integration tests using Testcontainers. This will involve setting up a testing environment with Docker containers for PostgreSQL, MinIO, and Keycloak to ensure the application is tested in an environment that closely resembles production.
*   **Audit**: Implement custom audit trail per action, and let the users search for audi logs via API 
*   **Customizable Security**

## M2

*   **Front-End "Google Drive" Like**: Develop a modern, user-friendly web interface for the document management system that mimics the look and feel of Google Drive. This will provide users with an intuitive way to manage their files and folders.

## M3

*   **Conversational Search (AI)**: Implement an AI-powered conversational search feature that allows users to find documents using natural language queries. This will involve integrating with a large language model (LLM) to understand user intent and provide more relevant search results.

Many other amazing features can be implemented
